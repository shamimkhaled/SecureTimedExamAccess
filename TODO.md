# TODO: Implement Asynchronous Email Sending with Tokenized Links

## Current Status
- [x] Analyzed codebase - Celery configured but not initialized, no email sending implemented
- [x] Confirmed user wants to proceed with implementation

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create Celery initialization file (exam_project/celery.py)
- [ ] Create Celery tasks file (exams/tasks.py) with email sending task
- [ ] Create email templates directory and templates
- [ ] Modify generate_exam_token endpoint to trigger email sending
- [ ] Update exam_project/__init__.py to load Celery
- [ ] Test the implementation

## Files to Create/Modify
- [ ] exam_project/celery.py (new)
- [ ] exams/tasks.py (new)
- [ ] exams/templates/emails/tokenized_link.html (new)
- [ ] exams/templates/emails/tokenized_link.txt (new)
- [ ] exams/views.py (modify)
- [ ] exam_project/__init__.py (modify)

## Testing Steps
- [ ] Start Celery worker
- [ ] Test token generation endpoint
- [ ] Verify email is sent asynchronously
- [ ] Check email content and tokenized link
